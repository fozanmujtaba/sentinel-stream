## 📱 LinkedIn Post (Ready to Copy)

🛡️ **Just completed my 6th Semester Project: Sentinel Stream** 🚀

I built an enterprise-grade **Real-Time Fraud Detection Platform** that can:

✅ Process **50+ transactions per second**
✅ Detect fraud in **under 2 milliseconds**
✅ Classify risks as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL
✅ Auto-create investigation cases for high-risk alerts

**Tech Stack:**
• Apache Kafka for real-time streaming
• Python & FastAPI for backend APIs
• Machine Learning (Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection
• Next.js & React for the dashboard
• PostgreSQL & Redis for data storage
• Docker for containerized deployment

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
📊 Stream processing & event-driven architecture
🤖 ML model deployment in production
⚡ Sub-millisecond latency optimization
🏗️ Microservices design patterns

This project demonstrates how modern FinTech companies detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## 🎓 Interview Talking Points

### Q: What does this project do?
"Sentinel Stream is a real-time fraud detection platform. It ingests financial transactions through Kafka, applies machine learning and velocity-based checks, and generates alerts in under 2 milliseconds. The dashboard shows live fraud alerts and supports investigation workflows."

### Q: What was the most challenging part?
"Achieving sub-2ms latency while running ML inference was challenging. I optimized by using async Python, efficient feature engineering, and caching. The sliding window velocity detection also required careful memory management to track transaction history per card."

### Q: How does the ML model work?
"I used Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm. It doesn't need labeled fraud data—instead, it identifies transactions that are easy to 'isolate' from normal behavior. Features include transaction amount, time of day, velocity count, and location risk scores."

### Q: How is this different from traditional fraud detection?
"Traditional systems use batch processing—they analyze transactions hours or days later. Sentinel Stream detects fraud in real-time, within milliseconds, using streaming architecture. It also combines rule-based velocity checks with ML, creating a hybrid approach that catches both known patterns and new anomalies."
